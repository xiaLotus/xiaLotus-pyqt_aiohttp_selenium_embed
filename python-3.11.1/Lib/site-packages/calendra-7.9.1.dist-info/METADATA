## Overview

Calendra is a Python module that offers classes able to handle calendars, list legal / religious holidays and gives working-day-related computation functions.

## History

Calendra is a fork of [Workalendar](https://github.com/workalendar/workalendar)
designed to be more extensible and introspectable, adding interfaces where
[Workalendar is philosophically opposed for the sake of simplicity](https://github.com/workalendar/workalendar/pull/79).

What can Calendra do that Workalendar cannot?

- Provides descriptions for holidays for the "day indicated" for each
  Holiday (such as '3rd Monday in August').
- Keeps distinct the indicated and observed dates for Holidays, such
  that it's possible to determine on what day a given holiday is observed.
- Allows the number of Holidays in a calendar year to be counted.
- Consolidates observance logic in the core code rather than requiring
  each calendar implementation to implement its own.

## Status

The project is stable and in production use. Calendra follows the principles of [semver](https://semver.org) for released verisons.

If you spot any bug or wish to add a calendar, please refer to the [Contributing doc](https://peopledoc.github.io/workalendar/contributing.html).

## Usage sample

```python-repl
>>> from datetime import date
>>> from calendra.europe import France
>>> cal = France()
>>> cal.holidays(2012)
[(datetime.date(2012, 1, 1), 'New year'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 4, 9), 'Easter Monday'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 5, 1), 'Labour Day'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 5, 8), 'Victory in Europe Day'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 5, 17), 'Ascension Day'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 5, 28), 'Whit Monday'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 7, 14), 'Bastille Day'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 8, 15), 'Assumption of Mary to Heaven'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 11, 1), "All Saints' Day"),
 (datetime.date(2012, 11, 11), 'Armistice Day'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 12, 25), 'Christmas')]
>>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 25))  # it's Christmas
False
>>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 30))  # it's Sunday
False
>>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 26))
True
>>> cal.add_working_days(date(2012, 12, 23), 5)  # 5 working days after Xmas
datetime.date(2012, 12, 31)
```

## Caveats

Please take note that some calendars are not 100% accurate. The most common example is the Islamic calendar, where some computed holidays are not exactly on the same official day decided by religious authorities, and this may vary country by country. Whenever it's possible, try to adjust your results with the official data provided by the adequate authorities.

Some countries have some holidays based on ephemerids and equinoxes. Those are computed for the previous and next 30 years to prevent big computations and dependencies.

## History

This project was born in 2013, as an answer to the question "how do we calculate *this date + 5 working days*?". It was a use-case for [PeopleDoc](https://www.people-doc.fr/), in their ticketing application, for calculating SLAs. And it began as a small open-source library, for France and the USA at first.

Thanks to PeopleDoc, this project grew and eventually became a world-wide library, with the help of dozens of contributors.

As of June 2021, this project has moved to its own organization.
